#summary Describes the Yammer Dashlet add-on for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This project provides a custom dashlet to display messages from the Yammer social network and allows the user to reply to existing messages and compose new messages.

Since Yammer requires all communications to be authenticated, the dashlet provides an easy method for you to connect it to your Yammer account.

*Note that the Yammer dashlet requires an Alfresco 4.0 build, or a 3.4 installation with upgraded Spring Surf libraries, and you must also install the Share Extras [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/wiki/ShareOAuth OAuth extension].*

=Installation=

The dashlet is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the dashlet, simply drop the `yammer-dashlet.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Yammer%20Dashlet
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Yammer Dashlet"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `yammer-dashlet.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home`
property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to your user dashboard.
  # Click the _Customize Dashboard_ button to edit the contents of the dashboard and drag the dashlet into one of the columns from the list of dashlets.
  # If you have not previously connected the dashlet to your Yammer account then hit the _Connect to Yammer_ button to do this.
