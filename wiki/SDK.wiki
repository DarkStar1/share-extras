#summary Sample projects for building your own add-ons

The Share Extras SDK provides a number of sample projects that you can use as templates to build your own add-ons.

All sample projects share a common folder structure for organising your repository, web-tier and client-side customisations. Apache Ant is used to build and deploy the files in standard formats.

Before you start using the projects, you will want to ensure you have a [DevelopmentEnvironment Development Environment] set up. Most Share Extras projects use Eclipse, and therefore the projects provide Eclipse project definitions for your use, although you are not _required_ to use Eclipse.

The following sample projects are part of the Share Extras SDK

  * The [SampleProject Sample Project] provides an example of a standard web-script-based add-on for Share with optional client-side component, using the example of a custom 'Hello World' dashlet.
  * The [SampleScriptAction Sample Script Action] allows you to easily hook repository-based JavaScript actions into the Share Document Library
  * The [SampleModules Sample Modules Project] provides a collection of Share 4.0 Modules, based on [http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/ddraper/ Dave Draper's excellent tutorials]
