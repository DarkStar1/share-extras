#summary Describes the Node Browser add-on for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This project defines a Share administration console component to navigate and view information on nodes stored in the repository stores, similar to the Node Browser component in Alfresco Explorer.

=Installation=

The component is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share. However as it includes a custom Java class, it must be installed directly into the webapp directory structure, rather than into `tomcat/shared/lib`.

To install the component, drop the `node-browser.jar` file into the following two directories within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server.

  * tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib
  * tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/lib

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Node%20Browser
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Node Browser"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `node-browser.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the webapp folders in your Alfresco installation, as in _Installation_, above.

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to an Administration page such as Users or Groups
  # In the left-hand-side navigation, click *Node Browser*
  # Enter a [http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Full_Text_Search_Query_Syntax search] to return some results, e.g. `name:test`
  # Click on a result to start browsing the nodes

=Known Issues=

  # In version 3.4 The Node Browser does not appear automatically in the _More..._ drop-down menu in the Share header component, however you can [http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Share_Header add it there] with some basic configuration.
