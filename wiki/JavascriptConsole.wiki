#summary Javascript Console add-on for Alfresco Share: Overview and Installation

=Introduction=

This project defines a Share administration console component to execute custom javascript code against the Alresco repository. It can be used for prototyping webscripts or to run administrative scripts.

=Installation=

The component is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the component, simply drop the `javascript-console.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Sandbox/Javascript%20Console/
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Javascript Console"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `javascript-console.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home`
property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to an Administration page such as Users or Groups
  # In the left-hand-side navigation, click *Javascript Console*
  # Enter Alfresco repository javascript code in the textarea at the top. Press the execute button to run the script.
  # You can use the special print(..) javascript command to output messages to the output window.
  # use Ctrl+Space for code completion. Note that only global objects and specific variables (document, space, variables ending in ...node) are completed.
