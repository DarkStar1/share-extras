#summary Issue-tracking guidance

As part of the migration from Google Code to GitHub, issues are now being tracked within the individual GitHub projects.

To report defects or suggest enhancements, please follow these steps

  # Navigate to the [https://github.com/share-extras Share Extras organisation] on GitHub
  # Locate the project relating to the add-on your issue concerns, in the list of repositories, and visit the project home page
  # Click into the Issues section and create an issue there. You will need to register a GitHub account if you have not done so already.
  # Consider forking the project and contributing a pull request. This will make it much more likely that your issue will be actioned.
