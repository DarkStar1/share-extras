#summary Describes the Train Times Dashlet add-on for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This project defines a custom dashlet which displays train status information from the National Rail Enquires web site.

http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Train%Times%20Dashlet/train-times-dashlet.png

=Installation=

The dashlet is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the dashlet, simply drop the `train-times-dashlet.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Train%Times%20Dashlet
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Train Times Dashlet"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `train-times-dashlet.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home`
property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to a site where you are a Site Manager, OR to your user dashboard
  # On the dashboard and click the *Customize Dashboard* button to edit the contents of the dashboard. Drag the Train Times dashlet into one of the columns from the list of dashlets to add it.
  # Click *OK* to save the configuration.
  # The dashlet should now be shown in your dashboard.
