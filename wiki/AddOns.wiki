#summary Overview of the add-ons hosted on Share Extras

Share Extras provides a wide range of add-ons for use with Alfresco Share 3.x and 4.x.

Add-ons are categorised by the type of additional function they provide.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DDashlet Dashlets]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DAction Actions]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DTheme Themes]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DAdminConsole Admin Console]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DForms Form Configuration]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DPageComponent Page Components]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=Addon%3DPage Pages]

Add-ons may be compatible with Alfresco 3.x, 4.x or both.

The add-on's wiki page should be tagged with the versions that have been tested and supported, and full details should be provided in the page text.

  * 3.x-compatible add-ons are tagged [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=AlfrescoVersion%3D3.x AlfrescoVersion-3.x]
  * 4.x-compatible add-ons are tagged [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/w/list?q=AlfrescoVersion%3D4.x AlfrescoVersion-4.x]

At the time of writing all add-ons are being reviewed for compatibility with Alfresco 4.x. Therefore the absence of an explicit AlfrescoVersion-4.x tag may not necessarily mean that it will not work with 4.x, just that it has not been tested.

In the [http://code.google.com/p/share-extras/downloads/list Downloads] section the versions supported should be obvious from the filename of the download.

  * Version *0.x* and *1.x* downloads are intended for use with Alfresco 3.x
  * Version *2.x* downloads are intended for use with Alfresco 4.x
