#summary Describes the Wiki Rich Content add-on for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This project implements a number of customisations to the Alfresco Share wiki component to improve it's visual appearance, and add support for dynamic tables of contents and syntax-highlighted code using [http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify Google Code Prettify].

=Installation=

The customisations are packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the customisations, simply drop the `wiki-rich-content.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Wiki%20Rich%20Content
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Wiki Rich Content"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `wiki-rich-content.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home`
property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to a site with some wiki content
  # Add some headings (at least 2) to have the table of contents be shown
  # Add some preformatted text to show the code highlighting
