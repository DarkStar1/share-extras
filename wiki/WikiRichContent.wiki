=Introduction=

This project implements a number of customisations to the Alfresco Share wiki component to improve it's visual appearance, and add support for dynamic tables of contents, embedded document previews, inline data lists/tables and syntax-highlighted code using [http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify Google Code Prettify].

=Installation=

The customisations are packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the customisations, simply drop the `wiki-rich-content.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Wiki%20Rich%20Content
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Wiki Rich Content"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `wiki-rich-content.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home`
property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to a site with some wiki content
  # Locate a wiki page and click the *Edit Page* link at the top of the page, _or_ create a new page by hitting the *New Page* button. You can now edit the contents of the page in the inline editor.
  # To have the *table of contents* be shown, add some headings (at least 2) to the page
  # To show the *code highlighting*, add some preformatted text to the page
  # To show a *document preview* or a YouTube or Vimeo *video*, use the *Insert/edit Link* button to add a link to the item and specify the target _Embed preview with link_ or _Embed preview with no link_ from the *Target* drop-down list
  # To turn an existing table into a [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/ YUI DataTable], add the class `datatable` to the table from the _Insert/edit new table_ dialogue.
  # To embed a Data List, create a new empty table, specifying the class `datatable:aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd`, where the last part is the name of a Data List in the site (which you can find on the end of the List URL in your browser)
  # If you want to show only specific columns from the Data List then add some column headings to the table, ensuring that these match the names of the properties in the Data List, e.g. `Name` or `cm_name`.
