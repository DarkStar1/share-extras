#summary Describes the Reset Password Dialog add-on for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This project provides a customised login page for Alfresco Share, including a password reset dialog that can be used to recover a lost password.

[http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Reset%20Password%20Dialog/screenshots/reset-password-dialog.png]

When presented with the dialog, the user can enter their e-mail address to be sent a message containing a new password and a reminder of their username.

The add-on should work with Alfresco version 3.4 and upwards.

=Installation=

The dashlet is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the dashlet, simply drop the `reset-password-dialog.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Reset%20Password%20Dialog
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Reset Password Dialog"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `reset-password-dialog.jar` in the `build/dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home` property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.
