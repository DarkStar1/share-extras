#summary Describes the Share OAuth add-on for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This add-on provides a custom Spring Surf connector and client-side helper class, allowing easy OAuth-based access to external resources. It is a prerequisite for the Twitter and Yammer dashlets provided by Share Extras.

=Installation=

The extension is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the component, drop the `share-oauth.jar` file into the following two directories within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server.

  * tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib
  * tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/lib

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Share%20OAuth
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Share OAuth"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `share-oauth.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.
