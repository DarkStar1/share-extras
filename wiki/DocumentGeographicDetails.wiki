#summary Describes the Document Geographic Details component for Alfresco Share

=Introduction=

This project provides an additional page component for the Document Details page to display a small map view for geotagged content items.

http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Document%20Geographic%20Details/document-geographic-info.png

=Installation=

The component is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the component, simply drop the `document-geographic-details.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

=Building from Source=

Check out the project if you have not already done so

{{{
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Document%20Geographic%20Details
}}}

Change into the new directory

{{{
cd "Document Geographic Details"
}}}

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

{{{
ant clean dist-jar
}}}

The command should build a JAR file named `document-geographic-details.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home`
property in Ant.

{{{
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
}}}

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

= Usage =

  # Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to a site containing geotagged content in the Document Library. Any content items with the Geographic aspect applied and Latitude/Longitude properties set can be used, but geotagged photos from camera phones will have this information populated automatically.
  # Locate one of the geotagged content item(s) and click into the Document Details page.
  # Scroll down the page to see the Geographic Information section below the metadata list. Note that this section will only be shown on the page if latitude and longitude values are available and the Geographic aspect has been applied.
